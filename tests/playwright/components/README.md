# Playwright Component Tests

## Status: Phase 2 Complete - Infrastructure Ready

The Playwright component testing infrastructure has been set up and configured, but the actual component tests are timing out due to complex dependencies in the Audafact components.

### What's Working:

- ✅ Playwright configuration (`playwright-ct.config.ts`)
- ✅ Component testing setup
- ✅ Module resolution and aliases
- ✅ Test environment configuration

### Why Tests Timeout:

The Audafact components have complex dependencies that are difficult to mock in the Playwright component testing environment:

- `useRecording` context hook
- Tailwind CSS classes requiring full compilation
- Web Audio API dependencies
- External libraries like `@wavesurfer/react`

### Recommended Approach:

Instead of component testing, we recommend using **Storybook** (Phase 3) for:

- Visual component testing
- Interactive documentation
- Better dependency handling
- Visual regression testing

### Future Component Tests:

If you want to add component tests later, consider:

1. Creating simpler, isolated components without complex dependencies
2. Using proper mocking strategies for contexts and APIs
3. Testing components in a more controlled environment

The infrastructure is ready if you decide to add component tests in the future.
