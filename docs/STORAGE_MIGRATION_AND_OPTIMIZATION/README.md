# Storage Migration and Optimization - Master Plan

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the R2 storage migration and optimization project, outlining the 7-phase approach to migrate from Supabase storage to Cloudflare R2 with a Worker-based media API.

## What Has Been Done

### Storage & CDN Migration ‚úÖ

- **Migrated objects** from Supabase ‚Üí Cloudflare R2
- **Established R2 layout** for library assets: `audafact/library/originals/<trackId>-<shortHash>.<ext>`
- **Created Cloudflare custom domain** for media delivery: `media.audafact.com`
- **Delegated DNS** to Cloudflare
- **Issued R2 API credentials** with bucket-scoped permissions (server-side only in Worker)

### Worker (Backend-less Media API) ‚úÖ

- **Deployed Cloudflare Worker** with:
  - Auth via Supabase JWT (calls `/auth/v1/user` with anon key)
  - File signing for playback: `/api/sign-file?key=...` ‚Üí short-lived HTTPS URL for R2 object
  - Delete endpoint: `/api/delete-file` (JSON `{ key }`) ‚Üí deletes R2 object after auth
  - Range streaming support: `/api/stream` (presign is preferred path)

### Database Alignment ‚úÖ

- **Tracks table backfilled** with `content_hash`, `size_bytes`, `content_type`
- **`file_key` adopted** in DB and app models
- **`file_url` treated as legacy/fallback** (normalized to a key when encountered)

### Phase 1: Database Schema & Models ‚úÖ

- **Uploads table created** with all required columns (`file_key`, `content_type`, `size_bytes`, `title`, `updated_at`)
- **Library tracks enhanced** with `preview_key` column and proper indexing
- **Database functions implemented**:
  - `check_user_upload_quota()` for daily upload quota enforcement
  - `check_library_access()` for tier-based library access control
  - `get_user_upload_usage()` for user upload statistics
- **Security & Performance**:
  - Row Level Security (RLS) policies for user isolation
  - Performance indexes for common query patterns
  - Constraint enforcement (unique file_key, positive size_bytes)
  - Automatic timestamp management with triggers
- **TypeScript Integration**:
  - Updated interfaces for Upload and LibraryTrack
  - Enhanced DatabaseService with new methods
  - Comprehensive type safety and error handling

### Frontend Integration ‚úÖ

- **Canonical identifier** is now `fileKey`, not a public URL
- **SidePanel refactor** to single audio element pattern:
  - Centralized play/stop/toggle; no leaking object URLs
  - Previews for both library and user uploads now sign the `fileKey` on demand
- **Drag-and-drop payloads** now carry `fileKey` (instead of file URL)
- **Legacy public-URL usage removed** from preview paths (no more `getPublicUrl()` for library)

### Current Architecture Snapshot (Source of Truth) ‚úÖ

- **Auth & DB**: Supabase (Edge Functions retained for Stripe)
- **Media storage**: R2 (private buckets)
- **Delivery**: Cloudflare CDN via `media.audafact.com`
- **Media API**: Cloudflare Worker (sign GET, sign PUT [to implement], delete, optional stream)
- **Frontend**: Vite React TS; media retrieved by signing `fileKey` through Worker

### Conventions & Standards (Keep These Consistent) ‚úÖ

- **Object addressing**: Always store and pass R2 object keys (e.g., `library/originals/‚Ä¶`, `users/<uid>/uploads/‚Ä¶`)
- **Mutability**: Treat library originals as immutable by embedding a short hash (or version tag) in the filename; updates create a new object/key
- **Preview vs original**: Previews (if/when generated) live under `library/previews/` with identical `<trackId>-<hash>` basename
- **Signing**: Client never sees R2 credentials; it requests short-lived URLs from the Worker
- **Caching**: Immutable assets must ship `Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable`
- **Security**: All Worker routes require a valid Supabase JWT; authorization rules (e.g., pro-only tracks) enforced at the Worker before signing

### Files and Functions Added ‚úÖ

**Web (audafact/web)**

- **Hooks**:

  - `src/hooks/useSingleAudio.ts` ‚Äî central playback controller (one `<audio>` element, stop/cleanup, toggle, signed URL handling)
  - `src/hooks/usePreviewAudio.ts` (refactored to Worker signing + usePreviewFromProvider)
  - `src/audio/usePreviewFromProvider.ts` ‚Äî preview/loop/cue playback on a shared AudioContext from AudioProvider
  - `src/context/AudioContext.tsx` ‚Äî AudioProvider / useAudioContext for shared AudioContext management

- **Services**:

  - `src/services/libraryService.ts` (modified) ‚Äî now outputs `fileKey` instead of `file_url`
  - `src/lib/keys.ts` ‚Äî helpers for constructing canonical R2 keys
  - `src/lib/api.ts` ‚Äî `signFile(key: string)` and `deleteByKey(key: string)` for Worker API calls

- **Components**:
  - `SidePanel.tsx` (refactored) ‚Äî now uses `useSingleAudio.toggle()` and drag-and-drop with `fileKey`
  - `LibraryTrackItem.tsx` ‚Äî preview calls `handlePreviewPlay(track, false)` and drag payload includes `fileKey`

**Worker (audafact/worker)**

- **Configuration**: `wrangler.toml` with Worker name "audafact-api" and R2 bindings
- **Code**: `src/index.ts` with routes for sign-file, sign-upload (stub), delete-file, and stream support
- **Helpers**: JWT verification, presigned URL builders, CORS handling, and range streaming

## Project Goals

- **Migrate** from Supabase storage to Cloudflare R2 for better performance and cost control
- **Implement** secure Worker-based media API for all media operations
- **Establish** proper CDN caching and security measures
- **Optimize** media delivery and user experience
- **Remove** legacy dependencies and technical debt
